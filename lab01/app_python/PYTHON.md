### Framework
I have developed the application using [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com) production ready framework.

Pros:
1. High performance
2. Easy to use
3. Scalability

Cons:
1. Limited ecosystem
2. Compatibility with older versions of Python
3. Maturity of the framework


### Best practices

Used _black_ code formatter,  _isort_ utility to sort imports alphabetically and _flake8_ linter. 

Followed PEP 8 style guide, added make file and documented my code.
